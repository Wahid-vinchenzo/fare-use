## 6. Show HN: I Built a Free AI LinkedIn Carousel Generator
- **Source:** HackerNews
- **Link:** https://carousel-ai.intellisell.ai/
- **Summary:** Show HN: I Built a Free AI LinkedIn Carousel Generator. <p>LinkedIn Carousel posts have the highest engagement rate, but as an engineer, instead of spending hours on Canva, I wanted to build a tool that can generate LinkedIn carousels automatically.<p>built this for my own startup and would like to give it to the HN community for free.<p>Feel free to try it out—no email or signup required!<p>How it works:<p>[1] Provide a prompt.
[2] Pick a theme (Professional, Creative, Tech, Minimalist, or Casual).
[3] Adjust settings (colors, number of slides, etc.) and add branding.<p>Tech-Stack
Built using Firebase Studio
LLM: Gemini 2.5 Flash lite (all I can afford to keep it free, and I found it was capable enough for the task. If there's interest, maybe I can add a pro version with stronger LLMs, and perhaps generate background images using Nano Banana)</p>

## 7. Show HN: Isolating AI-generated code from human code | Vibe as a Code
- **Source:** HackerNews
- **Link:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gace/vaac
- **Summary:** Show HN: Isolating AI-generated code from human code | Vibe as a Code. <p>Small Vite plugin: you put decorators on empty functions, run the build, and the function bodies are generated at build time into ./ai. Your source files stay unchanged.<p>The idea is to prototype fast without handing over project architecture to AI. Another use case is saving AI window context when generating generic code (e.g. JSX). For now it doesn’t understand full project context.<p>This is a working prototype of the idea - curious what others think.</p>

## 8. Show HN: LocalGPT – A local-first AI assistant in Rust with persistent memory
- **Source:** HackerNews
- **Link:** https://github.com/localgpt-app/localgpt
- **Summary:** Show HN: LocalGPT – A local-first AI assistant in Rust with persistent memory. <p>I built LocalGPT over 4 nights as a Rust reimagining of the OpenClaw assistant pattern (markdown-based persistent memory, autonomous heartbeat tasks, skills system).<p>It compiles to a single ~27MB binary — no Node.js, Docker, or Python required.<p>Key features:<p>- Persistent memory via markdown files (MEMORY, HEARTBEAT, SOUL markdown files) — compatible with OpenClaw's format
- Full-text search (SQLite FTS5) + semantic search (local embeddings, no API key needed)
- Autonomous heartbeat runner that checks tasks on a configurable interval
- CLI + web interface + desktop GUI
- Multi-provider: Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama etc
- Apache 2.0<p>Install: `cargo install localgpt`<p>I use it daily as a knowledge accumulator, research assistant, and autonomous task runner for my side projects. The memory compounds — every session makes the next one better.<p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/localgpt-app/localgpt" rel="nofollow">https://gi

This happens when:</p> <ul> <li><p>The chat history exceeds the model’s context window</p></li> <li><p>The session ends or resets</p></li> <li><p>A model version is retired or replaced</p></li> <li><p>You simply hit the memory cap</p></li> </ul> <p>But there’s a workaround—if you understand how AI memory actually works.</p> <h3>📌 Working Memory vs. Model Weights</h3> <p>Think of context memory as the AI’s <strong>short-term memory</strong>—like a human’s working memory. It only holds what’s immediately active in a conversation. Meanwhile, the AI’s <strong>training data</strong> is its <strong>long-term memory</strong>—baked into its neural weights. Once information is part of the model’s training, it doesn’t need to be reloaded every time.</p> <p>Id
